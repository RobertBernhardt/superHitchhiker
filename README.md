# The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Platformer

## A game about life, the universe, and jumping over things

In the beginning, the universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Several billion years later, someone decided to make a platformer game based on "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," which has made far fewer people angry but could still be regarded as an equally improbable move.

This is that game.

## What is this supposed to be?

This is a side-scrolling platformer game in which you, an unwitting human named Arthur Dent (or roving researcher Ford Prefect, if you prefer aliens who look suspiciously human), must navigate the perils of the galaxy equipped with little more than a bathrobe and a towel-collecting obsession.

Much like life itself, this game consists primarily of:
- Running from things you don't understand
- Jumping over obstacles that seem pointlessly placed in your way
- Collecting items that may or may not have any actual value
- Occasionally being surprised by poetry so bad it physically hurts

## How to Run the Game

First, ensure you have all the necessary files. If you don't, you've already failed, but don't panic—this is normal.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open a terminal in the project directory
3. Start a local web server (if you don't know how to do this, the Guide recommends asking someone who does)
4. Open your browser and navigate to the local server address
5. Experience the game, the universe, and everything

## Project Structure

This project is organized in a manner that would make even the Vogon bureaucracy proud:

```
/
├── index.html            # The page that holds the game (like a digital towel)
├── main.js               # The main entry point (unlike most entrances in the galaxy, this one is clearly marked)
├── src/                  # Source directory (where the actual code lives, if it can be said to 'live')
│   ├── config/           # Configuration files (numbers deemed important by pan-dimensional beings)
│   ├── entities/         # Game entities (things that move, mostly in ways you don't expect)
│   ├── scenes/           # Game scenes (digital rooms with no doors)
│   ├── ui/               # User interface (how the game communicates, mostly by lying to you)
│   └── utils/            # Utilities (digital tools, but not as useful as a towel)
└── assets/               # Game assets (not included, must be improbably generated)
```

## The Ultimate Question

If you've read this far, you're clearly the sort of being who asks questions. Perhaps you're even looking for the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. We regret to inform you that it's not in this README. It's probably not in the code either, though we haven't checked all of it. If you do happen to find it, please let us know. We already have the answer (it's 42), but the question has been rather elusive.

## Legal Disclaimer

This game is not affiliated with the official "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" franchise and is created for educational purposes only. No actual Vogons were harmed in the making of this game, though several lines of their poetry were digitally simulated, causing minor discomfort to the developers.

Remember: DON'T PANIC, and always know where your towel is.
