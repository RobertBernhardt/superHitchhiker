# The Source Directory

## Or, "Where All The Important Bits Hide"

This directory contains all the source code for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Platformer game. If the game were a body, this would be all the important organs that make it work—the heart, lungs, liver, and that weird bit at the back of the knee that nobody knows the purpose of but hurts terribly when you bump it.

## What's In Here?

An assortment of digital folders, each containing code files with purposes ranging from "absolutely essential" to "we're not entirely sure what this does but everything breaks when we remove it."

```
src/
├── config/    # Configuration settings that no one will ever change but we made configurable anyway
├── entities/  # Digital beings that bounce around the screen pretending to have purpose
├── scenes/    # Different stages of gameplay, much like the five stages of grief but with more towels
├── ui/        # User interface elements that tell you how badly you're doing
└── utils/     # Miscellaneous code that didn't fit anywhere else but seemed important
```

## Why Is It Organized This Way?

For roughly the same reason that digital watches were once thought to be a pretty neat idea. Someone, somewhere, decided that organizing code into folders would make it easier to find things. This theory has yet to be conclusively proven, but we continue to respect the tradition.

The true reason is that it's easier to pretend you know what you're doing when your code is neatly categorized into folders with important-sounding names.

## Should I Modify These Files?

That depends entirely on your tolerance for existential dread and digital catastrophe. Modifying these files is a bit like trying to replace parts of your car's engine while driving down the highway—technically possible, but generally inadvisable unless you really know what you're doing or have a remarkable indifference to consequences.

If you do decide to venture in, remember: always make backups. The universe has a nasty habit of deleting important things when you least expect it, and source code is no exception.

As the great digital prophet once said: "It compiles; ship it!"

## A Note on Code Style

The code in this directory adheres strictly to the principle that any programmer should be able to understand it, provided they have:

1. A degree in Computer Science
2. A thorough understanding of JavaScript and Phaser.js
3. A copy of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" (all five books in the trilogy)
4. A towel
5. A strong beverage

This code was written to be read by humans, though we make no guarantees about which species of humans or from which dimension they might originate.

Remember: DON'T PANIC, and may your functions always return what you expect them to. Or at least something. Or at the very least, not throw an exception that crashes the entire galaxy.
