# The Scenes Directory

## Digital Stages for Improbable Events

Welcome to the scenes directory, where the various stages of the player's journey through the galaxy are defined. Much like a theater production, these scenes represent different settings and situations, only with considerably more computational mechanics and slightly fewer prima donna actors demanding their own dressing rooms.

## What's In Here?

```
scenes/
├── BootScene.js    # Loading screen (marginally more exciting than watching paint dry)
├── MenuScene.js    # Main menu (where decisions are made and immediately regretted)
├── GameScene.js    # The actual gameplay (where towels are collected and Vogons avoided)
└── EndScene.js     # Game over/victory screen (with appropriately philosophical messages)
```

These files form the backbone of the game's progression, guiding the player from "I haven't started yet" to "I'm playing now" to "Oh, I've died" with a smoothness that belies the chaotic code beneath.

## The Dramatic Arc

### BootScene.js

The digital equivalent of the Big Bang—everything starts here. This scene is responsible for loading all game assets while displaying a reassuring "DON'T PANIC" message to distract the player from the fact that their computer is frantically shuffling data around. It's like the universe's creation, but with a progress bar.

### MenuScene.js

Where the player decides whether to embark on an adventure as Arthur Dent or Ford Prefect, a decision that has all the cosmic significance of choosing between two nearly identical breakfast cereals. Features buttons, animations, and the lingering sense that important choices are being made.

### GameScene.js

The main event! This sprawling file contains everything needed to create and manage the gameplay experience: spawning players, enemies, and collectibles; handling physics; tracking score; and triggering special events when the player reaches 42 points. It's the universe in microcosm, only with more predictable physical laws and fewer unexplained phenomena (though the Infinite Improbability Drive does its best to add some).

### EndScene.js

The omega to BootScene's alpha. This scene appears when the player has either completed all levels or died trying, displaying their score and an appropriately Adams-esque philosophical message about the futility of it all. Also features a "Play Again" button for those who haven't learned their lesson.

## The Scene Lifecycle

Each scene follows the standard Phaser.js lifecycle methods:

1. `preload()`: Load assets (though most are loaded in BootScene)
2. `create()`: Set up the scene's elements
3. `update()`: Run continuously to handle ongoing logic

This pattern repeats with all the predictability of an atomic clock, or a Vogon reading poetry before a demolition.

## Scene Transitions

Scenes transition from one to another like chapters in a book, if books had loading screens and the occasional unexpected crash:

```
BootScene → MenuScene → GameScene → EndScene → (back to MenuScene or GameScene)
```

It's all very circular, much like life itself but with fewer tax returns to file.

## Creating New Scenes

Should you wish to add new scenes to the game—perhaps a shop where Arthur can upgrade his bathrobe, or a mini-game where Ford tries to write entries for the Guide—simply create a new file extending Phaser.Scene and add it to the list of scenes in main.js.

The multiverse always has room for another scene, especially if it involves improbable physics and dry British humor.

Remember: DON'T PANIC, and if you find yourself stuck in an infinite loop of scene transitions, simply turn your computer off and go make a nice cup of tea instead. Some problems are best solved by ignoring them entirely.
