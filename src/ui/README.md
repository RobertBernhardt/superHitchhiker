# The UI Directory

## Digital Displays of Dubious Importance

Welcome to the UI directory, home to the various graphical elements that inform the player about things they probably already know or suspect. If the game were a car, this would be the dashboard—a collection of lights and numbers that occasionally flash to indicate you're doing something wrong.

## What's In Here?

```
ui/
└── HUD.js    # Heads-Up Display (floating numbers and bars that follow you everywhere)
```

At present, there's just the one file, which might seem a bit lonely, but it's quite content by itself, thank you very much. It contains all the code needed to display the player's score, health, collected towels, and other vitally unimportant statistics.

## The HUD (Heads-Up Display)

The HUD is the digital equivalent of someone following you around with a clipboard, constantly updating you on how well (or poorly) you're doing. It includes:

- **Score Display**: A number that increases when you do things right, creating a dopamine response that keeps you playing despite the general absurdity of collecting digital towels
- **Health Bar**: A colored rectangle that shrinks when you encounter Vogon poetry or other hazards, eventually leading to your untimely demise
- **Towel Counter**: Keeps track of how many towels you've collected, as if you couldn't simply count them yourself
- **Level Indicator**: Tells you which level you're on, in case you somehow forget

All of these elements float impossibly in the player's field of vision, defying both physics and good taste but serving the practical purpose of conveying information.

## Why It's Important

The HUD serves the same purpose in the game that informational signs serve in the real world—they tell you things like "Bridge Out Ahead" or "Beware of the Leopard" that might be useful to know before it's too late.

Without the HUD, players would be forced to deduce their health from subtle visual cues, count towels manually, and generally pay more attention to what they're doing, which would be terribly inconvenient and might even reduce screen time.

## Extending the UI

Should you wish to add more UI elements—perhaps a mini-map, or a digital watch display that Arthur would find impressive—you could create additional files in this directory. Potential candidates might include:

- **PauseMenu.js**: For when the player needs to step away from the game to make a cup of tea or contemplate the meaninglessness of existence
- **Inventory.js**: To display all the useless items Arthur has collected besides towels
- **GuideEntries.js**: Pop-up explanations of game elements, written in the style of the Guide itself

The universe of UI possibilities is vast, though arguably less interesting than the universe itself.

Remember: DON'T PANIC, and if you find the current UI either insufficient or excessive, remember that like digital watches, all user interfaces are simply passing fads in the grand scheme of things.
